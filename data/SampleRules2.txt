2 (type of game) - state dependent on current state AS WELL AS neighbor state


currentState state:neighborsInThatState state:neighborsInThatState finalState

first is going to be current state, after that will be neighbors in each state, last will be state to go to if that's true


instance variable for app.RulesParser
HashMap of Integer,Integer
--> eventually going to need that when constructing the app.Rules object

currentLine = myScanner.next();
lineSplit = currentLine.split("\\s+");
int currentState = Integer.parseInt(lineSplit[0]);
int finalState = Integer.parseInt(lineSplit[lineSplit.length-1]);

for(int i=1; i<lineSplit.length-1; i++){
    int state = Integer.parseInt(lineSplit[i].split(":")[0]);
    int neighborsInThatState = Integer.parseInt(lineSplit[i].split(":")[1]);



}

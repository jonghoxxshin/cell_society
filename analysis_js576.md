Design Review
=======

--------------------------------------------------
### Status

#### What makes the code well-written and readable
#### What makes this project's code flexible or not
#### What dependencies between the code are clear
  

You need to put blank lines to write some text

in separate paragraphs.

You can put blocks of code in here like this:
```java
    /**
     * Returns sum of all values in given list.
     */
    public int getTotal (Collection<Integer> data) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int d : data) {
            total += d;
        }
        return total;
    }
```

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.


You can put links to commits like this: [My favorite commit](https://coursework.cs.duke.edu/compsci307_2019spring/example_bins/commit/33a37fe42915da319f7ae140c8e66555cf28d2c8)


--------------------------------------------------
### Overall Design

You can also make lists:

* Bullets are made with asterisks

1. You can order things with numbers.

#### As briefly as possible, describe everything that needs to be done to add a new kind of simulation to the project.
#### Describe the overall design of the program, without referring to specific data structures or actual code
#### Justify why your overall code is designed the way it is and any issues the team wrestled with when coming up with the final design.


--------------------------------------------------
### Flexibility

#### Describe what you think makes this project's overall design flexible or not
#### Describe one feature from the assignment specification that was implemented by a team mate in detail:
What is interesting about this code? (why did you choose it?)
Describe the design of this feature in detail? (what parts are closed? what implementation details are encapsulated? what assumptions are made? do they limit its flexibility?)
How flexible is the design of this feature? (is it clear how to extend the code as designed? what kind of change might be hard given this design?)

--------------------------------------------------
### Your Design


#### Describe an abstraction (either a class or class hierarchy) you created and how it helped (or hurt) the design.
#### Discuss any Design Checklist issues within your code (justify why they do not need to be fixed or describe how they could be fixed if you had more time).
#### Describe one feature that you implemented in detail:
Provide links to one or more GIT commits that contributed to implementing this feature, identifying whether the commit represented primarily new development, debugging, testing, refactoring, or something else.
Justify why the code is designed the way it is or what issues you wrestled with that made the design challenging.
Are there any assumptions or dependencies from this code that impact the overall design of the program? If not, how did you hide or remove them?

### Alternate Designs



Here is another way to look at my design:
